[Fork this repository][fork], make some changes and then open a pull request!

Also note, we recommend to use descriptive commit names to prepare the Changelog easily.
Read that below in [Commit names](#commit-names)

> âš  Please don't open Pull Requests with features that haven't been discussed as [issues][featureReqs] yet.

<!--Below lines took from https://github.com/angular/material/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format-->

## Commit names

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

> Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters!<br/>
  This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various Git tools.

##### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the auxiliary tools such as release scripts
* **build**: Changes to the dependencies, devDependencies, or build tooling
* **ci**: Changes to our Continuous Integration configuration

##### Scope

The scope could be anything that helps specify the scope (or feature) that is changing.

Examples
- fix(select): 
- docs(menu): 

##### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no period (.) at the end

##### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

##### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**, **Fixes**, or **Relates to**.

> We highlight Breaking Changes in the ChangeLog. These are as changes that will require
  community users to modify their code after updating to a version that contains this commit.

##### Sample Commit messages
